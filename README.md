# Intro-to-Quantum-Computing
This is an applet designed to provide introductory knowledge about quantum computing with visual language and interactive user interface

## Introduction
Welcome to the Quantum Computing Applet! This interactive tool demonstrates the principles of quantum computing and contrasts them with classical computing methods. By using this applet, you can visualize the efficiency of quantum search algorithms and compare them to their classical counterparts.

## Getting Started
To begin exploring the world of quantum computing:

1. Open the applet in a web browser that supports JavaScript and HTML5.
2. Familiarize yourself with the interface which includes controls for adjusting quantum states and running simulations.

## Interface and Controls
The applet interface is divided into several sections:

- **Qubit Superposition Controls**: Use the sliders to adjust the angle (θ) and amplitude (α) of a qubit's superposition state. These represent the qubit's probability amplitudes and phase, which are crucial in quantum computing.
  
- **Number of Qubits**: Select the number of qubits (n) for the simulation. This determines the size of the quantum register.

- **Run Grover's Algorithm**: Click this button to initiate the simulation of Grover's algorithm using the parameters you've set.

- **Classical vs. Quantum Search Visualization**: Observe the animations that represent the search process in both classical and quantum approaches.

## Running a Simulation
To run a simulation:

1. Set the desired qubit angle (θ) and amplitude (α) using the sliders.
2. Choose the number of qubits (n) from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Run Grover's Algorithm" button to start the simulation.
4. Watch the animations that demonstrate the classical and quantum search processes.
5. Review the results displayed under each animation to compare the number of iterations each method took to find the target.

## Interpreting Results
After running the simulation, you will see two key pieces of information:

- **Iterations**: This number indicates how many steps the algorithm took to locate the target item.
- **Found Item**: This shows the position of the item found by the search algorithm.

In the quantum search, you will typically observe a smaller number of iterations, demonstrating the efficiency of Grover's algorithm compared to the classical search.

## Tips for Use
- Experiment with different angles and amplitudes to see how they affect the efficiency of the quantum search.
- Try simulations with different numbers of qubits to understand the scalability of quantum computing.
- Use the results of multiple simulations to gain insights into the probabilistic nature of quantum computing.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the applet:
- Ensure that your web browser is up to date and supports the necessary web technologies.
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.
- Refresh the page if the applet does not respond to your input.


Thank you for using the Quantum Computing Applet!
